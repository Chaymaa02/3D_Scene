The project was developed in the course 3D computer graphics At Grenoble-INP Ensimag. The project covers the implementation of a 3D scene in Python using OpenGL.

##Testing 

```
$ python3 viewer.py
```
## General info
First of all, press the 'space' button to have a close view of the scene, where the camera is placed behind the character (a fairy) that you will direct using the buttons: 'W' (equivalent to 'Z' for AZERTY keyboard) to move forward, 'A' (equivalent to 'Q') to move left, 'D' to move right.
And finally the 'N' button to switch between night and day modes.
